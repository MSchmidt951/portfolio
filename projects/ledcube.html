					An LED cube is a sructure that arranges LEDs in a lattice, forming a cube, I created a 5x5x5 LED cube meaning there are 125 LEDs in total. Each LED can have its colour changed induvidually so can be used to create patterns and ambient lighting.
					This was my first electronics project and I gained inspiration from and based this project on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX1GaPgSheI">this video</a>.
					To control the LEDs a signal is sent from the microcontroller to the first LED which is linked in a chain to the rest of the LEDs. This signal sets the strength of the red, green and blue channels of each LED without the need for any complicated wiring.
					I have programmed this to be controlled by most Arduino based microcontrollers, such as the Arduino Uno, or the Arduino Due if more processing power is needed.
