					For my Product Design A Level I created a planter for a professional client. The planter takes care of the plants by giving them everything they need to survive.<br />
					Below I have included some of the slides of the write up and other photos to get a summary of the work I did.

					To start the project I identified and investigated the need for a planter for indoor use which is able to care for the plants.<br />

					<img class="main-picture" src="/portfolio/img/alevedt/survey.png" /><br />
					<br />
					Based on the product outline from the investigation I researched existing products, visited garden centres and manufacturers, and analysed plant requirements to determine the planter specifications. Here is an extract from that research.<br />

					<img class="main-picture" src="/portfolio/img/alevedt/researchB.png" /><br />
					<br />
					From my investigation and research I was able to get together the specification for the planter.<br />
					<img class="main-picture" src="/portfolio/img/alevedt/spec.png" /><br />
					<br />
					Based on the specification I created some initial sketches and used them to generate four initial design ideas.<br />

					<img class="side-picture" src="/portfolio/img/alevedt/designThoughtsB.jpg" /><br />

					<img class="main-picture" src="/portfolio/img/alevedt/designIdea2.jpg" /><br />
					<img class="main-picture" src="/portfolio/img/alevedt/designIdea3.jpg" /><br />
					<img class="main-picture" src="/portfolio/img/alevedt/designIdea4.jpg" /><br />
					<br />
					I evaluated the design ideas to help decide on the final design.<br />
					<img class="main-picture" src="/portfolio/img/alevedt/designEval.png" /><br />
					<br />
					I decided to develop design idea 1 using client feedback and include the positive aspects of the other designs.<br />
					To find the optimum layout I used cardboard to make models of potential layouts.<br />
					Below are some layouts I tried. The design furthest to the right was the best as it has all three plants evenly and looks the most consistent.<br />
					<img class="main-picture" src="/portfolio/img/alevedt/cardboard.jpg" /><br />
				</p>
				<ul>
					<p>Here are some areas that I developed from the initial design idea:</p>
					<li>I will not have clear acrylic to hold the water due to sunlight getting through, accelerating algae growth.</li>
					<li>Don’t make parts of the planter difficult to access because the end user commented that this is an impractical aspect in design 2 but in design 4 it was very positive that everything was facing outward.</li>
					<li>In my design idea I had exactly enough space for a plant with a diameter of 12 cm so if there was any error in the manufacturing the specification point will fail, so I have increased the size of the hexagonal walls holding the planter. I have made each side 75 mm long, compared to the old 70 mm which allows for plants with a diameter of up to 13 cm.</li>
					<li>For my drainage I will need to have somewhere for the moisture to escape. I want this to be as near to the plants as possible, so I will have them next to the planter walls.</li>
					<li>I will have two grooves in the side of the base which will facilitate easier handling so that the user can carry it properly, satisfying spec point 3.3.</li>
					<li>The base layer was made of rusted steel, and as my client said that this would rust the surface that it is placed on which would be unacceptable. This is why I decided to make my base out of aluminium which is still  natural and does not affect the surface below and is also lighter than a block of steel (for specification 7.3). This will be cast into the desired shape so that no other extra processes will have to be used after the shape is made.</li>
					<li>I will have an aluminium sheet that will cover the top of the base. This will act as the layer between the drainage and soil. There will be some small gaps so that the water will be able to escape into the drainage layer. This will be soldered to the base and to the steel sides. I have chosen aluminium because it will be able to hold the weight of the soil and the joints used are waterproof.</li>
					<li>As I am not using rusted steel I will heat treat the steel instead, which can cause the steel to go different colours which can change and enhance the aesthetic of the planter. This could either be done as one block of colour or as many different colours to create a pattern. This also has the advantage of tempering the steel at the same time which will make the planter more durable and less likely to be deformed. Having two colours in the walls for my planter will make the product more aesthetically pleasing because it will be more interesting to look at and more contemporary.</li>
				</ul>

					The specification points that were not met are: 8.1 cost, 10.1 tank accuracy, 10.2 base thickness.<br />
					As 30 out of 33 points were met this is a very successful fully functioning prototype.<br />
					<br />
					Here is the client and end user feedback:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<p>Aesthetics:</p>
					<li>Black for the tanks is a bit too dark but is good for colourful plants</li>
					<li>The honeycomb design is modern</li>
					<li>The black containers are in the background so other aspects such as the plants are highlighted</li>
					<li>The metal is bent very evenly and professional</li>
					<li>It has a slick modern design that fits into both traditional and contemporary interiors</li>
					<li>All materials complement each other</li>
					<li>Like the splodges as they give variety</li>
					<li>The brown colour reflect plant colours as it is like the soil</li>
					<li>The steel is rainbow like</li>
					<li>The bending of the materials is neat and looks factory made and professional</li>
					<li>Design flows due to many soft curves in the materials</li>
					<li>The end user likes the use of different tiers and heights</li>
					<li>The seam of the steel is not aesthetically pleasing but it will disappear when plants are in the planter</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<p>Function:</p>
					<li>The product is a clever advanced system</li>
					<li>A cohesive unit that easily incorporates all aspects of plant care</li>
					<li>All sections sit and work together well</li>
					<li>It's easy to maintain plants with this because of the water source next to the tools and plants. This makes it convenient and effortless</li>
					<li>Don’t even have to worry about light for the plants</li>
					<li>You don’t have to know anything about plants to use it</li>
					<li>It is like a self contained ecosystem</li>
					<li>You thought about every aspect of plant care and design</li>
					<li>It looks and works like a high end product</li>
					<li>The system is built for modern people</li>
					<li>It is so easy to use</li>
					<li>It's handy to have live info about the planter</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<p>Improvements from the end users:</p>
					<li>Add a better finish to the bottom of the drainage escape</li>
					<li>The end user said they would want hinges on the lids which would go out to the side</li>
					<li>Have a more ergonomic grip for the lids</li>
					<li>Make the planter cheaper</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<p>Here are some improvements that I would make apart from the ones suggested above:</p>
					<li>Have the water tanks be extruded or injection moulded in order to have the acrylic tanks identical and the lids would fit on better</li>
					<li>Take advantage of batch production techniques in order to drive the cost down</li>
					<li>Improve the accuracy of creating the base</li>
				</ul>
