				<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
				<p>
					For my Computer Science A Level I created a website and server where people can upload, play and download games from.<br />
					To make the website function I used PHP, with a bit of JavaScript, for dealing with creating the dynamic web pages, for example choosing which game to display and retreiving the data.<br />
					The server runs on Linux with Apache and is designed to be managed by an end user so includes programs to help with usability of the server, for example starting and stopping the server.

				<h2>classes.php</h2>
				<p>
					classes.php contains the main portion of the code and is included in almost all web pages. This helps keep the code manageable from one main location.<br />
					It includes a class called Game and two child classes: DownloadableGame and WebGame.<br />
					These contain all the necessary methods for the games such as displaying previews, downloading and running the game on a web page.<br />
					There are also FAQ, Report and Search classes alongside some miscellaneous functions which will be discussed later.
				</p>
					
				<h2>Uploading</h2>
				<p>
					On the upload page users can fill in a form containing all the information about the game e.g. name, description, genre.<br />
					They will also need to upload a zip file containing the game. This will either be a game that will be downloaded and run on the users computer or a game written in javascript that will be able to be run directly on the web.<br />
					When it is uploaded the game is stored on the server waiting to be reviewed by the administrators before being allowed to be used by the public.
				</p>
					
				<h2>Administrators</h2>
				<p>
					The administrators can log into the site and control the site without having to access the server directly.<br />
					They are able to log in by entering the username and password in login.php. This generates a random key of 10 to 25 digits long of random numbers and letters which is used to encrypt the username and password.<br />
					A post request to checklogin.php is sent with the key and the encrypted username and password. They are then decrypted with the key and checked.<br />
					If they are correct then the key is stored as a cookie and the encrypted username and password is stored as session variables. Each time an admin page is used the username and password is checked on the server.
				</p>
				<p>
					When they are logged in they can view pending games and search for all games, including pending games.<br />
					In manageGame.php the admins can approve games (this moves the game out of the pending folder and makes it available to the public) or deny them.<br />
					Admins can test web games directly from the site on gameTest.php.
				</p>
					
				<h2>Downloading and Playing Games</h2>
				<p>
					The download page displays information about the game and allows the users to download the game.<br />
					On play.php the user can play web games. This page also displays similar games.
				</p>
					
				<h2>Navbar, Footer and Home</h2>
				<p>
					Each page has a navigation bar at the top and a footer at the bottom.<br />
					The navbar contains all the relevant links to navigate around the site and includes a search bar.<br />
					The footer has information about the site and gives a link to the FAQ pages.<br />
					On the home page users can view new and popular games.
				</p>
					
				<h2>Search</h2>
				<p>
					Users can search for games and filter them by type, genre, player count and rating.<br />
					The results can be ordered alphabetically or by upload date, and the order can be reversed too.
				</p>
					
				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<p>
					The admins can add FAQs which can be viewed by users.<br />
					The FAQ page shows a preview for all FAQs. Individual FAQs can be searched for and viewed.
				</p>
					
				<h2>Scripts</h2>
				<p>
					I wrote a few scripts that assist with running the server:<br />
					start.sh starts the server, sets up the log file and runs manageLoginAttempts.sh. This script limits the number of admin login attempts to 5 per hour.<br />
					stop.sh stops the server and manageLoginAttempts.sh.<br />
					sendEmail.sh sends an email to the administrators, it is used when a game is reported.
				</p>
					
				<h2>Log</h2>
				<p>
					A logging system exists where the notable activities can be seen. Each log file is for a particular day.<br />
					Errors are logged alongside user activities (rating, reporting and downloading) and admin activities (accepting/denying games).<br />
					This can help debugging and track how the site is used.
