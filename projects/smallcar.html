				<p>
					The aim of this project was to design and make a prototype of a remote control car that would be as small as possible, mainly focusing on the chassis design.<br />
					I achieved the small form factor by 3D printing a chassis where all the parts, including the four motors and the batteries, slot into.<br />
					It can be controlled with an Xbox remote and has a live camrea feed.

				<p>
					I chose a simple design for the car so it would be small and need less development work.<br />
					A custom PCB could have been made to reduce size further, however this project was aimed at using common, readily available parts.<br />
					<br />
					Two Raspberry Pis are used for this project. One has a controller connected to it, the other sending pulse width modulation (PWM) signals to the motor driver.<br />
					They communicate over WiFi and can send a live video feed from the car.<br />
					<br />
					Differential steering is used, which is when the two sides of the car spins at different rates, similar to how tanks steer.<br />
					This removes the need for extra items to be added to turn the wheels which would take up space.<br />
					<br />
					I tested the different parts individually to make sure that they were robust and fitted properly.<br />
					The design allowed for the parts to slot in and not need any other fixings.<br />
					The amount of support material was minimalised, only one part needed support material. This lowered printing time and reduced waste.
